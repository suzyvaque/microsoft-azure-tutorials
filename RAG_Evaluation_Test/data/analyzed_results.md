If the brake fluid level in the reser-
voir is low:

1\. Drive carefully to the nearest safe
location and stop your vehicle.

2\. With the engine stopped, check the
brake fluid level immediately and
add fluid as required (For more
details, refer to "Brake Fluid" in

operate properly, do not drive the
vehicle. We recommend that you
have the vehicle inspected by an
authorized HYUNDAI dealer.


#### Dual-diagonal braking system

Your vehicle is equipped with dual-
diagonal braking systems. This
means you still have braking on two
wheels even if one of the dual sys-
tems should fail.

With only one of the dual systems
working, more than normal pedal
travel and greater pedal pressure are
required to stop the vehicle.

ing, shift to a lower gear for addition-
al engine braking and stop the vehi-
cle as soon as it is safe to do so.
