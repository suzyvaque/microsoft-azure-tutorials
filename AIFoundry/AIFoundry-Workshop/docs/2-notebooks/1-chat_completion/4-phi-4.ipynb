        "\n",
        "**Phi-4** is a next-generation open model that aims to provide near GPT-4 capabilities at a fraction of the cost, making it ideal for many enterprise or personal use cases. It's especially great for chain-of-thought reasoning and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) scenarios.\n",

        "In this notebook, you'll see how to:\n",
        "1. **Initialize** an `AIProjectClient` for your Azure AI Foundry environment.\n",
        "2. **Chat** with the **Phi-4** model using `azure-ai-inference`.\n",
        "3. **Show** a Health & Fitness example, featuring disclaimers and wellness Q&A.\n",
